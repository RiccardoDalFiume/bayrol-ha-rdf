# Bayrol Pool Access Integration for Home Assistant

> **Note**: This project is a fork of the original [0xQuantumHome/bayrol-home-hassistant](https://github.com/0xQuantumHome/bayrol-home-hassistant) integration.
>
> **Why this fork?**
> - **Quick & Working Installation**: Provides a rapidly deployable and functional codebase.
> - **IP Ban Fix**: Overcomes Bayrol server ban issues by strictly aligning the MQTT client logic (Client ID formatting, connection parameters, and TLS logic) with the official web client.
> - **Multi-Controller Support**: Enables the use of multiple Bayrol controllers simultaneously within the same Home Assistant instance.

This custom integration allows you to monitor your Bayrol Pool Access device in Home Assistant. It uses a direct MQTT connection to the Bayrol Cloud.

## Features

- 40+ entities (including pH, Redox, Salt levels, alarm levels, etc.)
- Real-time updates via MQTT connection

## Tested Devices

- Bayrol Automatic SALT (All variants, e.g. AS5, AS7)
- Bayrol Automatic Cl-pH
- Pool Manager 5 Chlorine

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
2. Search for "Bayrol" and install the integration
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/bayrol_cloud` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings -> Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration" and search for "Bayrol"
3. Enter your Bayrol App Link Code (found in the Bayrol Pool Access Web App)

## MQTT Debug

To debug MQTT messages from the Bayrol device, you can use [**MQTT Explorer**](http://mqtt-explorer.com).

### Step 1: Get your Access Token
First, obtain your **App Link Code** from the Bayrol Pool Access Web App.  
Replace the placeholder `A-aBcDeF` in the following URL with your code and open it in your browser:

https://www.bayrol-poolaccess.de/api/?code=A-aBcDeF

You will receive a response like this:

{"accessToken": "23154245abc693883ef23823","deviceSerial": "212ABC1-016273"}

Please note down both 'accessToken' and 'deviceSerial'.

### Step 2: Configure MQTT Explorer
In MQTT Explorer, enter the connection details as shown below.
Use your 'accessToken' value as the 'Username'.

### Step 3: Add Subscription
In **MQTT Explorer**, click the **ADVANCED** button and add the following subscription:

d02/`deviceSerial`>/v/#

For example, if your `deviceSerial` is `212ABC1-016273`, the subscription will be:

d02/212ABC1-016273/v/#

### Step 4: Connect

Click the **CONNECT** button and you should see the messages floating in:

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on GitHub.

## Development and CI

The repository includes automated GitHub Actions workflows for validation and maintenance:

- HACS validation (`.github/workflows/validate.yaml`)
- Home Assistant hassfest validation (`.github/workflows/hassfest.yml`)
- Python tests with `pytest` (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`)
- Lint and format checks with `ruff` (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`)
- Dependency review on pull requests (`.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`)
- Automated stale issue/PR management (`.github/workflows/stale.yml`)
- Draft release notes generation (`.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml`)

You can run the main CI checks locally before opening a pull request:

```bash
uv venv
uv sync --group test --group lint
uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
uv run ruff check custom_components/ tests/
uv run ruff format --check custom_components/ tests/
```

When contributing, open pull requests against `main` to trigger the full CI suite.
